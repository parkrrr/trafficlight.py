#trafficlight.py

A traffic light controller using Python on a Raspberry Pi

### Roadmap
* Implement proper logging
* Somehow pipe commands into the script remotely to control the lights
* Expose an API of some sort to allow for integrations
* Add custom actions (rapid blink, slow blink, sequencing)
* *to be continued*
